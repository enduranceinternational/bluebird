# UAF Theme

The current iteration of `@uaf/theme` is strictly the generic (but Bluehost prioritized) Bootstrap Theme.

## Usage

`@uaf/theme` is designed to be used directly by specific brand themes, such as `@uaf/theme/src/bluehost/theme`. It should be built with `!default` flags throughout to allow easy overriding by variables only.

## Dependencies

- bootstrap-sass@3

## Roadmap

- Clean up bootstrap overrides, including button overrides which are sloppy.
- Define roadmap into discrete upgrades with proposed version numbers.

## Changelog

- February 2018: introduced
