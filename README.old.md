# User Apps Frontend UI Library

> Component library and style guide

## Overview

We would like all members of Product Delivery to be able to view a visual, coded out style guide representing the current truth in our codebase regarding UI components that are reusable across our apps.

## Strategy

In another story, we have a team working to upgrade the {{uaf-main}} repo to support Docz for component documentation. While they are in motion, we will be creating a parallel project:

* Set up a new project using Create React App 2

* Install Docz

* Investigate ways to import components from uaf-main to be visualized in the style guide project

** Note: Might require a parallel branch in uaf-main where we add the .mdx files

* Deploy project to a web service such as Heroku that is viewable by any member of Utah Product Development

## Acceptance criteria

Visual styleguide website viewable by any member of Utah product delivery that outlines our key shareable components, and allows development teams to easily extend and add to this.

### Extra credit or future iteration

Monitors uaf-main {{master}} branch for changes and recompiles and deploys with updated documentation

## Component documentation roadmap

* Bootstrap components (current UI Library)

* Other commonly used UI Library components

* Most shared custom app components
