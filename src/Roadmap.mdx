# Roadmap

The roadmap enables us to communicate the why and the what behind the work we are doing. It gives our Endurance stakeholders and everyone that utilizes the front end, the confidence that we are committed to delivering value on a reliable cadence.

We consider our roadmap a living document, with short timeframes and more frequent adjustments to accommodate changing priorities and new opportunities. Please reach out to us with feedback and ideas.

#### Build System Improvements (Q1-3)

We're looking into ways to improve how this documentation is built so we can provide the most up-to-date view of Bluebird. We aim to have an automated build system that will deploy an updated version of these docs to align with `uaf-main` deployments.

- [x] Transition `uaf-main` to `yarn` to gain `workspaces` ability
- [x] Configure `lerna` for easier monorepo management in `uaf-main`
- [x] Set up `bluebird` CICD to autodeploy new package versions
- [ ] Migrate design system source into `bluebird` repo & install on all `uaf-main` packages
