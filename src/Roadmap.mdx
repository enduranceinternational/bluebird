# Roadmap

The roadmap enables us to communicate the why and the what behind the work we are doing. It gives our Endurance stakeholders and everyone that utilizes the front end, the confidence that we are committed to delivering value on a reliable cadence.

We consider our roadmap a living document, with short timeframes and more frequent adjustments to accommodate changing priorities and new opportunities. Please reach out to us with feedback and ideas.

## Happening Now

**Build System Improvements**<br />
We're looking into ways to improve how this documentation is built so we can provide the most up-to-date view of our Design System. We aim to have an automated build system that will deploy an updated version of these docs to align with `uaf-main` deployments.

**Visual Language Updates**<br />
Our design team is at work on a "2.0" visual language to bring improved readability, design and accessibility features to our app.

- font standardization
- color consolidation
- patterns

## Coming Up Next

**Theme Repairs**<br />
While viewing the pages that document the current state of our app, your attention may be drawn to components that are improperly themed, which we aim to fix in future iterations.

- broken styles
- improper theming of Bootstrap elements

**Component Consolidation**<br />
Across the app, we have many custom components that veer from our Design System standards. We will be working to improve our suggestions for which components teams should use with `approved` and `avoid` tags within our Design System.

## Planning for the Future

As it stands today, The Blue Design System is just the start of many new features to come. We're looking for collaboration across all departments and teams to help expand and extend both our documentation and implementations.

We're looking for individuals or teams to get involved to help with some of our next steps, including:
