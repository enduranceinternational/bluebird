# Typography

## Headings

All HTML headings, `<h1>` through `<h6>`, are available.

<Playground>
  <h1>h1. Bootstrap heading</h1>
  <h2>h2. Bootstrap heading</h2>
  <h3>h3. Bootstrap heading</h3>
  <h4>h4. Bootstrap heading</h4>
  <h5>h5. Bootstrap heading</h5>
  <h6>h6. Bootstrap heading</h6>
</Playground>

## Heading classes

.h1 through .h6 classes are also available, for when you want to match the font styling of a heading
but cannot use the associated HTML element.

<Playground>
  <p className="h1">h1. Bootstrap heading</p>
</Playground>

## Heading with secondary

Use the included utility classes to recreate the `small` secondary heading text

<Playground>
  <h1>
    h1. Bootstrap heading <small>Secondary text</small>
  </h1>
</Playground>

## Lead

Make a paragraph stand out by adding .lead

<Playground>
  <p className="lead">
    Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus dolor auctor.
  </p>
</Playground>

## Inline text elements

Styling for common inline HTML5 elements.
.mark and .small classes are also available to apply the same styles as `<mark>` and `<small>`
while avoiding any unwanted semantic implications that the tags would bring.

While not shown below, feel free to use `<b>` and `<i>` in HTML5.
`<b>` is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance while `<i>` is mostly for voice, technical terms, etc.

### Alignment classes

Easily realign text to components with text alignment classes.
For left, right, and center alignment, responsive classes are available that use the same viewport width breakpoints as the grid system.

<Playground>
  <p className="text-left">
    Left aligned text.
  </p>
  <p className="text-center">Center aligned text.</p>
  <p className="text-right">Right aligned text.</p>
  <p className="text-justify">Justified text.</p>
  <p className="text-nowrap">
    No wrap text.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="text-sm-left">
    Left aligned text on viewports sized SM (small) or wider.
  </p>
  <p class="text-md-left">
    Left aligned text on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg-left">
    Left aligned text on viewports sized LG (large) or wider.
  </p>
  <p class="text-xl-left">
    Left aligned text on viewports sized XL (extra-large) or wider.
  </p>
</Playground>

  <p className="text-uppercase">Uppercased text.</p>
  <p className="text-capitalize">
    Capitalized text.
  </p>
</Playground>

## Abbreviations

Stylized implementation of HTML’s `<abbr>` element for abbreviations and acronyms to show the expanded version on hover.
Abbreviations have a default underline and gain a help cursor to provide additional context on hover and to users of assistive technologies.

### Basic abbreviations

<Playground>
  <abbr title="attribute">attr</abbr>
</Playground>

### Initialism

Add .initialism to an abbreviation for a slightly smaller font-size.

<Playground>
  <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language" className="initialism">

    <abbr title="Phone">P:</abbr> (123) 456-7890
  </address>
</Playground>

## Blockquotes

For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.
Wrap `<blockquote>` around any HTML as the quote.

<Playground>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer posuere
      erat a ante.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

### Blockquote - Naming a source

Add a `<footer>` for identifying the source.
Wrap the name of the source work in `<cite>`.

<Playground>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer posuere
      erat a ante.
    </p>
    <footer>
      Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite>
    </footer>
  </blockquote>
</Playground>

## Code

The `<code>` element displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code.
By default, the content text is displayed using the user agent's default monospace font.

### Inline

<Playground>
  <p>
    Wrap inline snippets of code with <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> should be wrapped as inline.
  </p>
</Playground>

### User input

The Keyboard Input element `<kbd>` represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device.
By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font.

<Playground>
  <p>
    Use the <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> to indicate input that is typically entered via keyboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    To switch directories, type <kbd>cd</kbd> followed by the name of the directory.
    <br />
    To edit settings, press <kbd><kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>alt</kbd></kbd>
  </p>
</Playground>

### Basic block

The `<pre>` element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file.
The text is typically rendered using a monospace font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.

<Playground>
  <p>
    Use <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> for multiple lines of code.
    Be sure to escape any angle brackets in the code for proper rendering.
  </p>
  <pre>Sample text here...</pre>
</Playground>

### Variables

The Variable element `<var>` represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context.
It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface

<Playground>
  <p>The volume of a box is <var>l</var> × <var>w</var> × <var>h</var>, where <var>l</var> represents the length, <var>w</var> the width and <var>h</var> the height of the box.</p>
</Playground>

### Sample output

The Sample Element `<samp>` is used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program.
Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font.

<Playground>
  <samp>
    This text is meant to be treated as sample output from a computer program.
  </samp>
</Playground>
