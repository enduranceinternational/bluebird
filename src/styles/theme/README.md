# UAF Theme

The current iteration of `@eigi/theme` is strictly the generic (but Bluehost prioritized) Bootstrap Theme.

## Usage

`@eigi/theme` is designed to be used directly by specific brand themes, such as `@eigi/theme/src/bluehost/theme`. It should be built with `!default` flags throughout to allow easy overriding by variables only.

## Dependencies

- bootstrap-sass@3

## Roadmap

- Clean up bootstrap overrides, including button overrides which are sloppy.
- Define roadmap into discrete upgrades with proposed version numbers.

## Changelog

- February 2018: introduced

## Support

This package is maintained by [Bluebird](mailto:bluebird@endurance.com) and [Team 418](mailto:418-team@endurance.com).
