# Introduction

The Blue Design System enables teams to design and build consistent user interfaces. This system includes guidelines for design implementation as well as code examples to empower teams to communicate effectively.

This is an evolving, collaborative project that teams will grow together.

## For Developers
Included are live code examples to give developers a strong starting point when assembling screens and allow them to quickly see components. Atomic classes will help developers customize components to fit various needs of a given design.

Start here:
  - [Atomic Variables](/atomic-css)
  - [Grid System](/grid-system)

## For Designers
This resource can be used by designers to familiarize themselves with our design principles and guidelines, as well as the documentation and specifications for all available components.

Start here:
  - [Typography](/typography)
  - [Grid System](/grid-system)
  - [Buttons](/buttons)

## Roadmap

As it stands today, The Blue Design System is just the start of many new features to come. We're looking for collaboration across all departments and teams to help expand and extend both our documentation and implementations.

We're looking for individuals or teams to get involved to help with some of our next steps, including:

**Theme Repairs**<br />
While viewing the pages that document the current state of our app, your attention may be drawn to components that are improperly themed, which we aim to fix in future iterations.

- broken styles
- improper theming of Bootstrap elements

**Component Consolidation**<br />
Across the app, we have many custom components that veer from our Design System standards. We will be working to improve our suggestions for which components teams should use with `approved` and `avoid` tags within our Design System.

**Build System Improvements**<br />
We're looking into ways to improve how this documentation is built so we can provide the most up-to-date view of our Design System. We aim to have an automated build system that will deploy an updated version of these docs to align with `uaf-main` deployments.

**Visual Language Updates**<br />
Our design team is at work on a "2.0" visual language to bring improved readability, design and accessibility features to our app.

- font standardization
- color consolidation
- patterns
