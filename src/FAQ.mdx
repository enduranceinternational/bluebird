## Who is the design system for?

The Blue Design System is built with the following personas in mind:

- The UX Designer, who wants to provide user experiences that are high quality, accessible, and consistent
- The UI Developer, who wants their code to be clean and consistent and conform to accessibility standards
- The Product Owner, who wants their product teams to focus on the hard stuff not the easy stuff so product development moves faster and delivers consistent and reliable product experiences every time
- The Product Stakeholders, who want to be assured of the accessibility, consistency, and quality of the user experience

I see a bug, how do I know if itâ€™s an Design System bug, if yes, how do I report it?
If you see an issue, open a JIRA ticket, otherwise here is our troubleshooting guide.

Do I need to do something special to get components to work in mobile?
One of our principles is to create components that are responsive. We do not have desktop components and mobile components - we have components that are optimized everywhere. So feel free to use our components for mobile!
