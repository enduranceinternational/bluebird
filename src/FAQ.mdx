## Who is the design system for?

The Blue Design System delivers a single source of truth for designers and developers to ease the creation of high quality user experiences.

- The UX Designer, who wants to provide user experiences that are high quality, accessible, and consistent
- The UI Developer, who wants their code to be clean and consistent and conform to accessibility standards
- The Product Owner, who wants their product teams to focus on the hard stuff not the easy stuff so product development moves faster and delivers consistent and reliable product experiences every time
- The Product Stakeholders, who want to be assured of the accessibility, consistency, and quality of the user experience
