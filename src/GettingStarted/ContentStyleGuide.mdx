## UX writing best practices (general do’s & don’ts) 

Good UX writing is three things:
- Clear 
- Concise
- Helpful

### 1. Make it clear

*Ask: Could my mom (technophobe) understand this?*

Be consistent with directions, terminology, CTAs, and locations. Don’t sacrifice clarity for anything. Don’t bury useful info under unnecessary detail. 

**Don’t**

For packages supporting unlimited and unmetered disk space or data transfer, we do not have defined limitations. These resources are “unmetered” and, while the resources are not infinite, we believe customers should have all the resources necessary to build an online presence within each package. However, our hosting services are not intended to support large multimedia files or file sharing.

**Do**

Plans marked “unlimited” and “unmetered” don’t have defined limitations. Those plans offer more than enough storage and bandwidth for 99.95% of our customers. In the rare case that a website utilizes more resources than normal (storing large multimedia files or file sharing), we’ll alert you via email and suggest higher-bandwidth plans.  


### 2. Make it concise

*Ask: Am I writing extra?*

Start with the most simple way to explain something and then provide options for people to pursue deeper technical understanding if they want, either by reading on or by clicking to an article or by using a tooltip. 

**Don’t**  
Thank you for choosing Bluehost. You have made the right choice in selecting us as your web hosting and eBusiness provider. We provide excellent customer service and look forward to a great relationship. Your next step is choosing a domain.

**Do**  
Thanks! Next we’ll set up your domain (your website’s address). You can create a new domain, use one you already own, or make one later. 

### 3. Make it helpful

*Ask: Am I making things easier?*

**Don’t**  
SSL certificates are small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization’s details. When installed on a web server, it activates the padlock and the https protocol and allows secure connections from a web server to a browser. The certificate binds a domain name, a server name, or a hostname with an organizational identity.

**Do**  
An SSL certificate encrypts information between your website and the server. It adds a layer of security, helps your customers trust your website, and means your website will rank higher in search engines.


**Here are other best practices we follow (because there can totally be more than 3).**

### 4. Make it enjoyable

*Ask: Are we having fun?*

This is a balance. Below, we added two sentences to the SSL example. They bring a human element and clarify the idea, but they also make the copy longer. It’s a tradeoff, and there are places where this works better than others. 

**Do**  
An SSL certificate encrypts information between your website and the server. Imagine the information as a personal letter. Instead of mailing it in a see-through envelope, you’re mailing it in a security envelope. The certificate adds a layer of security, helps your customers trust your website, and means your website will rank higher in search engines.

### 5. Make it a conversation 

*Ask: Does this sound like something an actual human would say?*

Set up user decisions with a question. “Which domain do you want to use?” Use helper copy to whisper extra info if you think something might need extra clarification. 

**Don’t**  
Bluehost makes launching, maintaining, and updating your website on WordPress easy and reliable. Bluehost provides a feature-rich toolset that offers the perfect balance of control and flexibility.

**Do**  
You aren’t just building a website—you’re creating a digital home for your business. At Bluehost, we make it easy to customize and control each stage of building, optimizing, and improving your website on WordPress. 

### 6. Make it for mobile

*Ask: Can I use this from my phone?*

### 7. Make it scannable

*Ask: Can a user understand this well enough to make a decision even if they skip all the body copy?*

Sometimes people read every word. Sometimes they scan. Write for both. Front-load the most important info.

Use clear headers and subheaders so users can find what they want  
Use numbered lists help users understand rankings or ordered instructions  
Use bullet lists to:  
- Quickly convey reasons to do something 
- Breakup barfy blocks of texts and compound sentences
- Highlight important, actionable info
- Introduce topics  
For the sake of both brevity and clarity, skip introductory clauses.

**Don’t**

### If Bluehost had a dating profile

[Name] Bluehost

Honestly, there are so many people with great ideas out there. Helping them make things happen makes me happy. If you want to team up and make something awesome, swipe right.

## Our voice: empowering, genuine, approachable

Our brand voice is a reflection of the relationship between our audience and us. 

That’s why our brand voice needs to speak to three things:
 
- The brand’s role in their audience’s lives 
- The brand’s personality/how that role comes to life
- How the brand mirrors the language and accessibility of the audience. 

### What does that mean for Bluehost?

**Our role: Empowering (but not patronizing)**  
We are cheerleader and coach, inspiring our users with the confidence they need to find success online and to feel a sense of achievement at every milestone. We celebrate our users’ successes and encourage them to keep going.  

**Our personality: Genuine (but never brusque)**  
Friendly, upfront guidance makes experiences (even difficult ones) enjoyable. We are honest and thoughtful whether we are walking someone through a process, introducing them to a new product, or helping them solve a problem. This aspect of our voice should make it clear that we are trustworthy. 

**Our level of accessibility: Approachable (but smart)**  
Our audience is made up of technophiles and technophobes, so when we talk with them in a way that everyone can understand. Simplicity and clarity is the goal. 

### Voice chart 

This is how our voice comes to life across content

| | Empowering | Genuine | Approachable |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Concepts | Coach and support. Win by helping others win. Create possibilities. | Honesty is best. Be sincere. Show caring through respect and by setting clear expectations. | Democratize tech. Anyone can do this. An invitation to the cool-kids table.  |
| Vocabulary | Define and teach terms they’ll need later. | Use specific words for the audience. Avoid words that qualify, generalize—avoid fluff. | No jargon. Choose the most commonly understood word. 6th grade reading level. |
| Grammar | Simple, complete sentences. Use the imperative when possible. | Active voice. (The noun verbs the subject.) | Use first person plural. Use “we” and “us” when talking about Bluehost. Don’t use “I”. Use the Oxford comma. Use present tense (future if you must) |
| Verbosity | Connect their goals to fun, achievable tasks. Break them down into smaller steps if needed. | To the point with a little love. | Explain what you need to even if it adds a few extra words. Use the abbreviation if the abbreviation is more commonly used than the full term. Humans use contractions. |
| Punctuation | Exclamations for customer success! (but not for general notifications) | No ellipses (they are the side-eye of punctuation) No semicolons Use commas for natural pauses even if it’s not technically necessary. | Parentheticals (right?!) No terminal punctuation on headlines/section headers (unless there are multiple clauses). Use hyphens if they make it more clear |
| Capitalization | Sentence case | Sentence case | Sentence case |

### Our tones (it’s plural for a reason)

Our voice is constant, but we apply aspects of our voice differently for different situations and to produce different effects. Here are a few examples of how we use situational tones to modify our voice. 

Voice elements 
- Empowering
- Genuine
- Approachable 
	
Situational tones 
- Serious
- Encouraging 
- Straightforward 
- Clarifying
- Helpful

| Circumstance | User’s emotion | Our response voice + tone |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Destructive action | Naive, determined, apprehensive  | genuine + serious + straightforward |
| Serious errors (our fault)| Concerned, worried, mad, impatient, frustrated | genuine + serious + apologetic |
| Serious error (not our fault) | Uncertainty, frustration, confusion | genuine + serious + straightforward |
| Minor errors (our fault)| Annoyed but tolerant  | approachable + apologetic |
| Minor errors (not our fault) | Annoyed, disrupted | approachable  + clarifying + witty |
| Confirmations for account changes | Expected, dismissive, ambivalent | genuine + helpful + clarifying|
| Selling/product pages | Interested, seeking, hopeful, open, curious, overwhelmed | empowering + encouraging + helpful |
| Billing/processing payment  | Hopeful, concerned, fulfilled, transactional | approachable + encouraging + straightforward |
| User success! | Accomplished, excited, hopeful, motivated | empowering + witty + encouraging |
| Platform success | Confident, OK, trusting, secure, pleased | approachable + straightforward  |

## General style, grammar, and mechanics

### POV

Write in first person plural “we/us/our,” speaking directly to our audience “you/your”

*You can always call us if you need extra help. We’re available 24/7.*

### Tense

Use present tense unless you’re describing an outcome or something that’s about to happen, then use future. 

*Your account is up to date.*

*After you choose a theme, you’ll be able to customize your colors and fonts.* 

### Slang

Slang doesn’t always translate well, so only use slang words that are commonly understood. Use slang sparingly. 

### Acronyms and abbreviations  

If there’s any chance your reader won’t recognize an acronym or abbreviation, spell it out the first time you use it. After that, you can just use the acronym or abbreviation. 	

*SSL (Secure Socket Layer)*

If an acronym is more commonly used than the words it stands for, just use the acronym, no need to spell it out. 

*email not electronic mail (obviously)*

### Capitalization

Sentence case is more approachable and easier for readers to process, so we use sentence case for just about everything:
- Headlines
- Headers
- Subheaders
- CTAs
- Field labels

Exception: we treat locations within the product (Home, Account Center) as proper nouns, so title case is the rule. Lucky them. Brand names (SiteLock, WordPress, Bluehost) keep the capitalization they come with. 

**WhatAboutCamelCase?**

Only use CamelCase if you’re referring to a product or brand name that employs this trend.
- HostGator
- WordPress 
	
### Terminal punctuation 

**H1**  
A headline doesn’t get terminal punctuation unless it consists of more than one clause or if it’s a question. 

*This is a headline*

*This is also a headline. It is punctuated.*

*Did you know this is a headline?*

**H2**  
Same as H1

**Subhead**  
Subheaders are usually complete sentences, so terminal punctuation is the rule. 

**Normal text/body copy**  
Use terminal punctuation. 

**Field labels**  
These aren’t usually complete sentences, so no terminal punctuation is needed. 

**Field prompts**  
No terminal punctuation needed here either. 

**CTA Buttons**  
No punctuation (ever)

*Click it*

**CTAs (inline links)**  
Sentence case and terminal punctuation because, hey, they’re sentences. If you want to learn more about capitalization, click here. 

### Numbers, times, and dates

**Numerals**  
Use numerals instead of writing out the number. Numerals take less time to process and are more scannable. Exception: large approximate should be written as *7 million* or *12 billion* not *7,000,000* or *12B*. For numbers over 999, use a comma. *1,000*

**Dates and times**  
Use numerals for day of the month, 3-letter month abbreviations, and 4 numerals for the year: DD/Mon/YYYY = *1 Apr 2025*.

**Months of the Year**  
*Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec*

**Days of the Week**  
*Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat*

**Time**  
General Date & Time Guidelines 
- No space between the numbers and the am/pm 3:00pm
- Spell out “Yesterday” and “Today”, “minutes” and “seconds” but not days of the week or months of the year.
- Use relative time (yesterday, in two days, in a few minutes) when possible—it’s easier for users to understand. 

**HH:MMam**
- Use 12-hour time in an hour/minute format.
- Use am and pm
- Use noon and midnight instead of 12am or 12pm to avoid confusion.
- If the time is on the hour, leave off the minutes. 3pm not 3:00pm.

**Time zones and daylight savings time**
- Avoid using suffixes to note time zones and daylight saving time. Whenever possible, we'll show times and dates in local time for the user. If you absolutely have to include a timezone (because of a time-sensitive event like a webinar or an expiration) use the three-letter abbreviation. 
- 3:30pm MST for Mountain Standard Time 
- 3:30pm MDT for Mountain Daylight Time

**Money**  
*$2.99*  
For termed pricing, use a slash and the term. *$2.99/mo*

**Ranges**
To denote a range, use an en-dash ( – ) with no spaces. *9–5*

## Usage rules for components and content types

### H1

Sentence case

No terminal punctuation unless the header is two clauses or is a question

Primary purpose: 
- help users find their way
- help convey essential info for scannability

### H2

Sentence case

No terminal punctuation unless the header is two clauses or is a question 

Primary purpose: 
- help users find their way
- help convey essential info for scannability 

### Subheader

Sentence case 

Tip: try to make the header so clear and helpful that you don’t need a subheader.
Complete sentences with terminal punctuation. 

Primary purpose: help provide extra context if your header isn’t enough. 

### Checkout boxes

Sentence case

No terminal punctuation unless more than one clause 

### Body copy

Body copy comprises sentences, so use sentence case and terminal punctuation. Keep sentences short and format large blocks of copy into smaller paragraphs. Use bullets or bold key words to make content scannable.  

### Field labels

Sentence case

1–2 words

No terminal punctuation

### Field pre-fills/suggestion

Sentence case

Terminal punctuation 

Can be a nice place to add delight

### Card headers

Sentence case unless proper noun

No terminal punctuation

### CTAs - buttons

Sentence case

### CTAs - inline

These usually live within body copy as complete sentences or clauses, so they get sentence case and terminal punctuation. 

### FAQs

Use questions people might actually ask. Don’t be afraid to repeat features included earlier in the product page, since some people will scan directly through to the FAQs

### Comparison tables

These tables should make it easy to visually spot differences between product options. Keep related features on the same x-axis.

### Error message

Follow tone guidance. Always let the user know what action to take or what to expect.
