# Installation

## Adding to a web app

### Step 1: Install the package from our NPM Registry

Add the design system to your project with the package manager of your choice. We recommend [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

```sh
$ yarn add @uaf/design-system --save
# installed to dependencies in `package.json`
```

> **Tip**

> You can install a specific version by specifying it in your add command, such as `yarn add @uaf/design-system@~1.0.0 --save`. The `~` symbol will allow upgrades to patches that are released after the specified version. Replacing the `~` with a `^` will allow upgrades to minor versions.

### Step 2: Reference the styles from your app

There are a few ways to pull our styles into your app:

#### SCSS

The design system can be imported directly, or as a variables sheet via [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) in `.scss` format:

```scss
// import everything
@import "~@uaf/design-system";

// import variables only
@import "~@uaf/design-system/assets/stylesheets/variables";
```

> Tip

> The `~` used above is used by Webpack to identify `node_modules` libraries within Sass files. If you aren't using Webpack, consult your build system documentation for the proper syntax to find the `node_modules` directory.

### Webpack Loader

```js
// import directly to app
import "@uaf/design-system";

// import as object
import styles from "@uaf/design-system";
```

> Tip

> Consult your webpack loader for the proper import strategy for your usage.

#### CSS

To add the compiled css to your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@uaf/design-system/dist/styles.css" />
```

> Tip

> Consult your bundler for the proper reference to the `node_modules` package.

#### CDN

To add our styles from our CDN, you can install the design system by adding the following tag to your app's HTML:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://bluehost-cdn.com/media/app/1.0.0/styles.css"
/>
```

## Running locally

### Step 1: Install the project

The project is dependent on having both [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed. After you have these set up on your development machine, run the following command to install its dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn
# installing...
```

### Step 2: Start the app

Starting the app is as simple as running:

```sh
$ yarn start
# Compiled successfully!
#
# You can now view uaf-ui-library in the browser.
#
# http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```
