# Installation

## Adding to a web app

### Step 1: Install the package from our NPM Registry

Add the design system to your project with the package manager of your choice. We recommend [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

```sh
$ yarn add @uaf/design-system --save
# installed to dependencies in `package.json`
```

> **Tip**

> You can install a specific version by specifying it in your add command, such as `yarn add @uaf/design-system@~1.0.0 --save`. The `~` symbol will allow upgrades to patches that are released after the specified version. Replacing the `~` with a `^` will allow upgrades to minor versions.

### Step 2: Reference the styles from your app

There are a few ways to pull our styles into your app:

#### SCSS

The design system can be imported directly, or as a variables sheet via [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) in `.scss` format:

```scss
// import everything
@import "~@uaf/design-system";

// import variables only
@import "~@uaf/design-system/assets/stylesheets/variables";
```

> Tip

> The `~` used above is used by Webpack to identify `node_modules` libraries within Sass files. If you aren't using Webpack, consult your build system documentation for the proper syntax to find the `node_modules` directory.

### Webpack Loader

```js
// import directly to app
import "@uaf/design-system";

// import as object
import styles from "@uaf/design-system";
```

> Tip

> Consult your webpack loader for the proper import strategy for your usage.

#### CSS

To add the compiled css to your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="@uaf/design-system/dist/styles.css" />
```

> Tip

> Consult your bundler for the proper reference to the `node_modules` package.

#### CDN

To add our styles from our CDN, you can install the design system by adding the following tag to your app's HTML:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://bluehost-cdn.com/media/app/1.0.0/styles.css"
/>
```

## Sketch Design System

A Sketch Asset Library is maintained on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MIK8jwEdpLlEBOJ5G6tY7ixVZXFGtJSV). To gain write access you will need to speak to the lead on the Bluehost Design system.

Sketch allows us to create a shared library of foundational colors, text styles, patterns and components that can be easily be used in your designs. This allows for rapid prototyping of features, using consistent elements from the design system. As the system is hosted on Google Drive, you can quickly sync changes to your design(s).

## Running locally

### Step 1: Install the project

The project is dependent on having both [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed. After you have these set up on your development machine, run the following command to install its dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn
# installing...
```

### Step 2: Start the app

Starting the app is as simple as running:

```sh
$ yarn start
# Compiled successfully!
#
# You can now view uaf-ui-library in the browser.
#
# http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```
