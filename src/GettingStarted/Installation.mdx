##### Installing Yarn

1. Install Yarn version 1.13.0 [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable). NOTE: choose the option that doesn't include Node.
2. Merge master into your branch and resolve conflicts.
3. If you see a conflict with `npm-shrinkwrap.json` use `git rm npm-shrinkwrap.json` (delete the shrinkwrap, we no longer use this).
4. Delete your current node_modules directory with a command like rm -rf node_modules.
5. Run the command `yarn install` to generate an updated `yarn.lock` file.
6. `git add yarn.lock` to add the yarn.lock file with your changes to the merge commit.
7. Make sure everything is staged and all conflicts are now resolved, and commit the merge with<br />`git commit --no-verify` (accept the default merge message).
8. You should now be up to date and running with yarn. Below are some common commands you can run in place of npm.

##### Resolving conflicts with yarn.lock

If you ever run into a conflict with yarn.lock, Yarn has an automatic merge built in, but you do need to run the `yarn` command. When it runs it will automatically generate a repaired yarn.lock file without conflicts. You need to commit the updated yarn.lock file with your merge.

##### Common Yarn commands
