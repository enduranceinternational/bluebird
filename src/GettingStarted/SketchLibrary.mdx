# Sketch Library

[Sketch Libraries](https://sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/) allow collaboration across multiple design files by allowing designers to apply consistent styles to elements in their document.

> The best design happens when designers collaborate together. With Libraries, designers can now share Symbols and styles across documents and have them update to be always kept in sync.

The Sketch Asset Library is maintained on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MIK8jwEdpLlEBOJ5G6tY7ixVZXFGtJSV). To gain write access you will need to speak to the UX Lead on Bluebird.

Sketch allows us to create a shared library of foundational colors, text styles, patterns and components that can be easily be used in your designs. This allows for rapid prototyping of features, using consistent elements from Bluebird. As the system is hosted on Google Drive, you can quickly sync changes to your design(s).

## Setup

1. Download [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
2. Once installed, open [Bluehost UI Library](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MIK8jwEdpLlEBOJ5G6tY7ixVZXFGtJSV)
3. In Sketch, navigate to `File → Add as Library`
4. To manage your libraries click `Sketch → Preferences → Libraries`

Once installed you will now have access to all symbols in the system (mainly form inputs and buttons), via the `Insert` menu in Sketch.
