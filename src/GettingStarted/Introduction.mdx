# Introduction

The Blue Design System enables teams to design and build consistent user interfaces. This system includes guidelines for design implementation as well as code examples to empower teams to communicate effectively.

This is an evolving, collaborative project that teams will grow together.

## For Developers

Included are live code examples to give developers a strong starting point when assembling screens and allow them to quickly see components. Atomic classes will help developers customize components to fit various needs of a given design.

Start here:

- [Atomic CSS](/atomic-css)
