# Introduction

The UAF Design System enables teams to design and build consistent user interfaces. This system includes guidelines for design implementation as well as code examples to empower teams to communicate effectively.

This is an evolving, collaborative project that teams will grow together.

Here youâ€™ll find reusable User Interface (UI) components that can be leveraged across our products to help you create high quality User Experiences (UX). The goals of this system are to:

- Provide simplicity and ease of use when composing app UIs.
- Help teams ensure consistency in their UIs by providing shareable components, tools and specifications.

## For Developers

Included are live code examples to give developers a strong starting point when assembling screens and allow them to quickly see components. Atomic classes will help developers customize components to fit various needs of a given design.

- [Utility Classes](/src-utility-classes)
- [Grid System](/src-foundations-grid-system)

## For Designers

This resource can be used by designers to familiarize themselves with our design principles and guidelines, as well as the documentation and specifications for all available components.
