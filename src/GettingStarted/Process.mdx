# Process

## Component Lifecycle

The new component lifecycle goes through several phases and changes hands between Product, UX and Development teams along the way.

1. New components are proposed weekly in UX Design Review meetings in an open forum where a designer presents a proposed change, concept or new component to the entire UX group in an open invite meeting.
2. In following UX Design Reviews the proposal is iterated upon, until agreement or veto is reached.
3. In the case of approval, the new changes are moved into an approved state and get moved to a backlog for prioritization and version assignment.
4. Once prioritization is complete, a development planning phase commences, and when planning is prepared a proposed version number will be assigned to the new component (or change).
5. When the component makes it to a sprint, it is coded into the assigned version tag for `uaf-design-system` and upon deployment is pushed out and built by a CI/CD process which sends the new version to our internal NPM registry (http://verdaccio.dev.provo1.unifiedlayer.com/).
6. Upon publishing, the new design library version can be consumed by development teams by installing the updated package version to their part of the app. This upgrade process often involves a degree of regression testing as there may be auxiliary or unrelated style changes that come with the upgrade(s) along the way to the desired version.

## Versioning

Versioning is done using semver. For reference, please see [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/).

Versions are assigned after refinement and planning has been completed to help identify priority as versions are typically deployed in a linear manner. This means subsequent versions include all previous changes.

_Note:_ In special cases, a patch can be applied to previous minor or major versions, but will require subsequent versions to be updated with the patch.
