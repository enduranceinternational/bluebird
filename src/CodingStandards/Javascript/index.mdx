# Javascript

This guide documents the suggested standards for writing and formatting Javascript code and maintain the same code consistency in all EIGI's client application source code. 

We would be following the `Airbnb` style guide to maintain consistency and maintainability across engineering teams.

_Note:_ `Airbnb`guide assumes you are using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), and requires that you use [babel-preset-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-airbnb) or the equivalent. It also assumes you are installing shims/polyfills in your app, with [airbnb-browser-shims](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airbnb-browser-shims) or the equivalent.
